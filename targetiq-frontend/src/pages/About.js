       <p><h3>Precision Through Insight. Confidence Through Data.</h3></p>
       <p>TargetIQ is an AI-powered shooting analysis platform designed for everyday shooters, competitive marksmen, and instructors who want to improve their performance with clarity and precision.
          We combine computer vision and intelligent coaching algorithms to turn your paper target images 
          into detailed performance insights‚Äîgiving you instant feedback, shot grouping analysis, scoring breakdowns, 
          and personalized drills. Whether you're practicing at an indoor range, fine-tuning your fundamentals, 
          or tracking your progress over time, TargetIQ is your personal coach in your pocket.</p>

          <p><h3>üéØ Why We Built It</h3></p>
          <p>Shooting is both a skill and a science. But too often, shooters are left guessing:</p>
          <p>- <i>"Why do I keep shooting low-left?"</i></p>
          <p>- <i>"Are my groups improving?"</i></p>
          <p>- <i>"What drills should I focus on?"</i></p>
          <p>TargetIQ was created to solve that. Our mission is to bring data-driven training to the shooting community without 
            the need for expensive gear, complicated devices, 
            or advanced editing software. Just snap a photo of your target, 
            upload it, and get clear, personalized feedback in seconds.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p><h3>üí° How It Works</h3></p>
            <p>1. Upload your paper target ‚Äì Snap a photo after your range session.</p>
            <p>2. Enter shooting details ‚Äì Distance, firearm, handedness, etc.</p>
            <p>3. Get your AI report ‚Äì We detect shots, analyze your grouping, score zones, and offer coaching insights.</p>
            <p>4. Track your progress ‚Äì See how your accuracy improves over time.</p>
            <p>You can download your reports as PDFs, and receive email summaries. Use them to compare your performance over time 
              and stay motivated.</p>
